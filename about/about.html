<div class="text-container">
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>During my past positions I have developed many skills that can be used in this position. This includes time management from my time in both paint sprayer and construction as it was always necessary to meet deadlines, organization in my maintenance work, as well as communication, problem solving and planning skills to ensure optimal prioritisation and organisation.</p>
                
                I am currently engaged in a 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Development with Just IT training. I am looking to build on my skills and develop new skills to develop a career as a developer. I have completed several projects using HTML, Python, and JavaScript which have been posted in my GitHub portfolio.</p>
            
            I am currently looking to change my career to allow for a more flexibility in where I can work from and to have a better work/family lifestyle. I aspire to develop my technical skills as a Software Developer and apply my analytical and problem-solving skills to assist the completion of complex projects whilst learning new technologies along the way.
